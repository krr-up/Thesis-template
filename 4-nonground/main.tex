\section{Solving Non-Ground Temporal Programs}

To capture the semantics of temporal rules with free variables, we need to raise
our discussion from the propositional to the first order level. For HT
the corresponding first order logics are the logic of Quantified
Here-and-There, and Quantified Equilibrium Logic, both of which are
well studied in the literature \cite{peaval06a} \cite{peaval08a}. The
discussion of a first order variant of THT, however, is somewhat less
exhaustive. Descriptions of the semantics of the telingo temporal
answer set solver remain on the propositional level. A paper where the
first order case is considered is \cite{agcapevidi17a}, where the
authors define the logic of Quantified Here-and-There with static
domains for operators $\Next$, $\alwaysF$ and $\eventuallyF$. They
consider a syntactic fragment of first order temporal formulas called
\emph{splittable temporal formulas} over possibly infinite traces,
define a safety condition for such programs, and discuss a solver for
such programs, STeLP. In this section, we will extend the definitions
of this paper to all the temporal operators in the language discussed
in this thesis, and extend the discussion to temporal programs, over which define a
much more permissive, but similarly powerful safety
criterion. Finally, we provide a grounding procedure that we prove to
be semantics-preserving, allowing us to reify and solve the resulting
propositional temporal program using our meta-telingo encoding.
