\section{Approach  }\label{sec:approach}

In this section, we move on to the implementation, where ASP is used to translate temporal and dynamic formulas into a declarative representation of their corresponding $\AFW$ to validate traces of dynamic programs. A general overview of the whole procedure is shown in the workflow diagram in Figure 1. 
Each step of the process is explained in detail in the upcoming sections. 

Our approach remains fully declarative as it consists solely of logic programs.
Throughout the extent of the implementation we use the ASP system $\clingo$ \cite{gekakasc14a}, comprised of the grounder $\gringo$ and the solver $\clasp$. 
The grounder first generates a propositional representation of the input program by instantiating all variables, which are written using upper-case letters. Then, the solver computes the stable models. Additionally, $\clingo$ complements ASPâ€™s declarative input language with high-level constructs which we introduce in the course of the section.

    \caption{The diagram shows an overview of the workflow for the integration. All components consist of ASP encodings. Components marked in dark blue are generated by the system. Dotted lines correspond to the inclusion of elements from the specific application domain. Lastly, the component in grey refers to the optional task of trace generation. }
