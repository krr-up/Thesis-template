    Temporal and dynamic extensions of Answer Set Programming (ASP) have played an important role addressing dynamic problems, such as planning, as they allow the use of temporal operators to reason with dynamic scenarios in a very effective way. 
    In this project, we exploit the relationship between automata theory and both linear temporal and linear dynamic logics on finite traces. 
    This relationship allows us to represent temporal constraints from ASP in terms of alternating automata.
    Our automata-based approach generates a declarative representation of the alternating automaton, which enables two different reasoning tasks: generating traces satisfying a constraint and checking the satisfiability of a given trace. 
    Regarding practical applications, the implementation was tested with intra-logistics among multiple robots, where it provided a concise way of filtering plans that enforce temporal goals.
    Eventoght the performance results were not favorable, this work remains a profitable first survey of these connection, as it helped define the path for future research.
